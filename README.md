# Muse Blink Light Demo

This code was written to demo how easy it is to integrate a mobile, consumer-grade EEG device with an Arduino microcontroller.

This demo requires basic skills in hardware and intermediate skills in software development, you should be able to run a python3 script on your computer, and load an arduino script to an Arduino microcontroller.

An outline of the project flow:
-   upload script to arduino
-   connect muse to computer (bluetooth)
-   run muse-io 
-   run blink.py script

## Prep Work


-   Install [Muse SDK](http://developer.choosemuse.com/research-tools/getting-started)
-   Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
-   Requres Python 3


## Starting

### Arduino

-   Load the `led_blink.ino` onto your Arduino
-   record Arduino port name e.g. `/dev/ttyS0`

### Muse

-   connect muse device to bluetooth
-   run muse-io to get started.
-   For linux users, this is done by running: `./muse-io --device <mac-address> --osc osc.udp://localhost:5000`
    -   This starts the muse-io server, it is streaming data on port 5000.
-   If you installed MuseLab (which you probably did if you have `muse-io`, you can quickly check the status of your signal)
-   You can now run the `blink.py` script.
